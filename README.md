Decline in Mall Revenue although there was considerable footfall. One of the major reason for this was emergence of Online Shopping. 
Our goal is to increase Mall revenue which can be achieved by :
1.Identifying visit patterns seen across the Mall. Visit patterns can be specific to either a demographic segment or a store / store â€“ category.
2.Optimizing the layout of the shopping center
